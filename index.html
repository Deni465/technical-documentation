          <p>
            Snapchat makes most of their money through snap-ads. Those were some
            of the main reasons Snapchat got so popular, because kids and other
            people like to take pictures and videos with the filter. These are
            some of the filters, the stories are also what mostly started up the
            Snapchat trend.
